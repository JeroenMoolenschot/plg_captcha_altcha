## Quick start

[Download](https://github.com/akeeba/plg_captcha_altcha/releases/latest) the extension's ZIP file. Its name is `plg_captcha_altcha-VERSION.zip` where _VERSION_ is the latest version number.

> ‚ùóÔ∏èDo not download the `plg_captcha_altcha.zip` file (without a version number). That's a file automatically generated by GitHub containing the source code in this repository. You cannot install this in Joomla!.

Log into your site and go to System, Install, Extensions. Click on the Upload and Install tab. Use the ‚ÄúOr upload file‚Äù button to open a file picker dialog; find the ZIP file you downloaded, and double-click on it. Joomla! will now install the extension.

Go to System, Manage, Plugins and enable the ‚ÄúCAPTCHA - ALTCHA‚Äù plugin.

Go to System, Global Configuration and select this plugin as your Default CAPTCHA.

If you have any extensions which were using a different CAPTCHA plugin explicitly configured in them, remember to edit their options and choose the ‚ÄúCAPTCHA - ALTCHA‚Äù plugin instead.

For more detailed usage information take a look at our [documentation](https://github.com/akeeba/plg_captcha_altcha/wiki).
